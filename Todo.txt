Watchlist todo:
- Steam Trading Cards
- Ready option in shop panel rather than button icons
- Always shoot while aiming option toggle? (only available when above option is disabled?)
- Fix level gen player/miniboss placement bug?
- Save PlayerPref for VSync on or off? or some other persistent setting.
