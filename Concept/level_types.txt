Difficulties:
1: levels where max(abs(x), abs(y)) <= 1
2: levels where max(abs(x), abs(y)) == 2
3: levels where max(abs(x), abs(y)) >= 3

Enemies have weights associated with them, as well as a weight-increase value, which increases the weight of that enemy the more it is chosen to be included in a map.

A level of difficulty x cannot pick enemies of lv greater than x.

Weights for lv. 2 enemies are generally lower and increase slower than lv 1.
Weights for lv. 3 enemies are generally lower and increase slower than lv 2.

Guaranteed picks:
1: none
2: 2 lv 2 enemies
3: 1 lv 2 enemy, 2 lv 3 enemies

Level sizes:
1: 42x42, 44x40, 40x44, 46x38, 48x36
2: 54x54, 56x52, 52x56, 58x50, 60x48, 63x46
3: 64x64, 66x62, 62x66, 68x60, 60x68, 70x58, 73x56, 76x54

BSP room counts:
1: 3-4
2: 4-6
3: 5-8

Generation types:

50% chance of CA, 50% chance of BSP

CA - If number of open positions is less than number of enemies * 13 + 1, regenerate level. Place enemies in turn, apply weights, and for each placement try to find good position (method below). Also use find good position method for placing player.
	Method for finding good position:
	1. Select random position (from pool of remaining open positions)
	2. Check that position is at least 200 away from already placed enemies.
	3. If not, repeat from step 1, but reduce value in step 2 by 20.
	4. Place enemy and remove position, and positions within 2 range, from pool of open positions.

BSP - If number of rooms is less than 2 + difficulty level, regenerate level. Place player in a room and remove the other open positions in that room from placement pool. If number of remaining open positions is less than number of enemies * 10, regenerate level. For each remaining room, 75% chance to set as united-spawn room (enemies placed "intelligently", spawn simulatneously as player enters room). After designating a room as united-spawn, there is a 50% chance to remove the rest of the positions in that room from valid placement pool (so it will only ever spawn the united-spawn enemies). Otherwise enemy positions and positions within 1 range of those are removed. If get to last room AND all rooms so far have been united-spawn rooms AND there are still "guaranteed picks" remaining, OR have run through all rooms and still have enemies to place OR still going through rooms but don't have 4 or more enemies still to place, halt room  iteration and place remaining enemies via CA's "good placement" approach (but only remove positions within 1 range).
	Method for "intelligently" placing united-spawn enemies in room:
	1. 1 enemy in each of the 4 corners, 1 space in from each wall. The first enemy placed gets temporary boosted weight for rest of united-spawn placement in this room.
	2. If enemies to place still > 2, and length of room >= 180, place enemies at midpoints along east and west walls, 1 space in from wall.
	3. Do same as step 2 for width/north, south walls.
